I picked up coding as a hobby during the COVID shutdown. Currently I am working as a Freelance Audio Visual Technician focusing primarily on corporate meetings and convention work. The department i most enjoy working in is Lighting. I have also worked as a Lighting Director in live music for the past 10 years.
